# Project Euler Solutions for 1 to 100

## It is advised if you are undertaking to solve Project Euler, refer mathematical algoritms not solutions though these are my solutions for the project euler.

### These will be completed as I solve them[ONLY TILL PROBLEM 100]

## On the Site of Project Euler this note is given hence no problem above 100

Note: The rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first 100 problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for them to be discussed elsewhere.

### Note from Project Euler about consequences for sharing more that 100: Please do not deprive others of going through the same process by publishing your solution outside of Project Euler. Members found to be spoiling problems beyond #100 will have their accounts locked.

### Please read the terms [here](https://projecteuler.net/copyright) if you want to make use of the solutions
